Slab P-T conditions for the weak crust case as well as pertinent perplex files to be read in and a description of the data structure that is produced.

P-T files: {age_step}.{depth_from_slabtop}.txt
  age step: 0 to 118
  depth: slabtop, 5km, 10km, moho
  consists of 5 columns: X-position(km), Z-Position(km), lithostatic_P(GPa), Total_P(GPa), Temperature(C)

age_convergence.txt consists of 4 columns: agestep, model age, convergence at trench (cm/yr), dip at 125km

README_data_structures.txt: text file describing the data structures produced within the Jupyter Notebooks.
